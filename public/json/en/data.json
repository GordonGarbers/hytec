    "General Terms and Conditions",
    "- 1 Applicability, Form,&div&bold",
    "(1) The following General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter AGB) apply to all business relationships of",
    "HYTEC Baumaschinen GmbH&div",
    "Bogwardstrasse 6&div",
    "21423 Winsen (Luhe)&div",
    "Managing Director: Udo Blanck&div",
    "with our customers ('Buyer').&div",
    "",
    "(2) HYTEC Baumaschinen GmbH sells to entrepreneurs (§ 14 BGB), legal entities under public law, or special assets under public law and private individuals.",
    "(3) The AGB apply, in particular, to contracts for the sale and/or delivery of movable items ('Goods'), regardless of whether we manufacture the Goods ourselves or purchase them from suppliers (§§ 433, 651 BGB). Unless otherwise agreed, the AGB in their version valid at the time of the Buyer's order or, in any case, the last version communicated to them in writing, are deemed a framework agreement for similar future contracts, without us having to refer to them again in each individual case.",
    "(4) Our AGB apply exclusively. Deviating, conflicting, or supplementary general terms and conditions of the Buyer only become part of the contract if we have expressly agreed to their validity in writing. This approval requirement applies in any case, even if we carry out the delivery to him without reservation with knowledge of the Buyer's terms and conditions.",
    "(5) Individual agreements made with the Buyer in individual cases (including side agreements, supplements, and amendments) take precedence over these AGB. The content of such agreements is, subject to evidence to the contrary, based on a written note on the sales contract or our written confirmation.",
    "(6) Legally relevant declarations and notifications from the Buyer concerning the contract (e.g., setting deadlines, notices of defects, withdrawal, or reduction) must be made in writing, i.e., in written or text form (e.g., letter, email, fax). Statutory formal requirements and further evidence, particularly in cases of doubt regarding the authority of the declarant, remain unaffected.",
    "(7) References to the applicability of statutory provisions are for clarification only. Therefore, the statutory provisions apply even without such clarification, unless directly modified or expressly excluded in these AGB.",
    "- 2 Conclusion of Contract&div&bold",
    "(1) Our offers are non-binding and subject to change. This also applies if we have provided the Buyer with catalogs, technical documentation (e.g., drawings, plans, calculations), other product descriptions, or documents – even in electronic form – for which we reserve ownership and copyright rights.",
    "(2) The Buyer's order for Goods is considered a binding contract offer. Unless the order specifies otherwise, we are authorized to accept this contract offer within 7 days of receiving it.",
    "(3) Acceptance can be declared in writing (e.g., by order confirmation) or by delivering the Goods to the Buyer.",
    "- 3 Delivery Time and Delay in Delivery&div&bold",
    "(1) The delivery time is agreed individually or indicated by us when the order is accepted. If this is not the case, the delivery time is approximately 2 weeks from the conclusion of the contract.",
    "(2) If we are unable to meet binding delivery deadlines for reasons beyond our control, we will inform the Buyer without delay and provide an estimated new delivery deadline. If the performance is still not available within the new delivery deadline, we are entitled to withdraw entirely or in part from the contract. Any consideration already provided by the Buyer will be refunded immediately. Claims for damages are excluded. In this context, non-availability of performance means, in particular, late delivery by our supplier if we have concluded a congruent covering transaction, we are not responsible for the delay, or we are not obligated to procure in individual cases.",
    "(3) The Buyer's default in delivery is determined by the statutory provisions. In any case, a reminder from the Buyer is required.",
    "(4) The Buyer's rights according to § 8 of these AGB and our statutory rights, particularly in the event of an exclusion of the obligation to perform (e.g., due to impossibility or unreasonableness of performance and/or subsequent performance), remain unaffected.",
    "- 4 Delivery, Passing of Risk, Acceptance, Default of Acceptance&div&bold",
    "(1) Delivery is ex-warehouse, which is also the place of performance for delivery and any subsequent performance. Upon request and at the Buyer's expense, the Goods will be shipped to a different destination (shipment purchase). Unless otherwise agreed, we are entitled to determine the method of shipment (in particular, the transport company, shipping route, packaging) ourselves.",
    "(2) The risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the Goods passes to the Buyer at the latest upon transfer. However, in the case of a shipment purchase, the risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the Goods, as well as the risk of delay, passes to the Buyer as soon as the Goods are delivered to the carrier, the freight carrier, or any other person or institution designated to carry out the shipment. If an acceptance is agreed, this is authoritative for the transfer of risk. For an agreed acceptance, the statutory provisions of the contract law apply accordingly. The transfer or acceptance is equivalent to acceptance if the Buyer is in default of acceptance.",
    "(3) If the Buyer is in default of acceptance, fails to cooperate, or delays our delivery for other reasons for which the Buyer is responsible, we are entitled to claim compensation for the resulting damage, including additional expenses (e.g., storage costs). For this, we charge a flat fee of EUR 9.50 per calendar day, starting from the delivery deadline or, in the absence of a delivery deadline, from the notification of the Goods' readiness for shipment. The right to prove higher damages and our statutory claims (in particular, reimbursement of additional expenses, reasonable compensation, cancellation) remain unaffected; the lump sum is to be offset against further monetary claims.",
    "- 5 Prices and Payment Terms&div&bold",
    "(1) Unless otherwise agreed in individual cases, our current prices at the time of contract conclusion apply, ex-warehouse, plus applicable value-added tax.",
    "(2) In the case of a shipment purchase (§ 4 (1)), the Buyer bears the shipping costs from the warehouse and the costs of any transport insurance requested by the Buyer. Any customs duties, fees, taxes, and other public charges are borne by the Buyer.",
    "(3) The purchase price is immediately due. However, even within an ongoing business relationship, we are always entitled to perform a delivery only against advance payment. We declare a corresponding reservation, at the latest with the order confirmation.",
    "(4) If the Buyer is in default of payment, the purchase price is subject to interest during the delay of 8% above the base interest rate. We reserve the right to assert a higher default damage. Our claim to business maturity interest (§ 353 HGB) against merchants remains unaffected.",
    "(5) The Buyer is only entitled to set-off or retention rights insofar as their claim has been legally established or is undisputed.",
    "(6) If it becomes apparent after the contract is concluded (e.g., through an application for the initiation of insolvency proceedings) that our claim to payment of the purchase price is jeopardized by the Buyer's lack of performance capability, we are entitled to refuse performance according to the statutory provisions and – if a deadline is set – withdraw from the contract (§ 321 BGB). In the case of contracts for the manufacture of unique items, we can withdraw from the contract immediately; the statutory regulations on the dispensability of setting a deadline remain unaffected.",
    "- 6 Retention of Title&div&bold",
    "(1) Until full payment of all our current and future claims from the purchase contract and an ongoing business relationship (secured claims), we reserve ownership of the sold Goods.",
    "(2) The Goods subject to retention of title may not be pledged to third parties or transferred by way of security before full payment of the secured claims. The Buyer must notify us immediately in writing if an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings is filed or if access by third parties (e.g., seizures) is made to the Goods belonging to us.",
    "(3) In case of a breach of contract by the Buyer, in particular, non-payment of the due purchase price, we are entitled to withdraw from the contract or/and demand the Goods based on the retention of title according to the statutory provisions. A demand for the Goods based on retention of title does not simultaneously constitute a declaration of withdrawal; rather, we are entitled to only demand the Goods and reserve the right of withdrawal. We can only assert these rights if we have previously unsuccessfully set a reasonable deadline for payment to the Buyer or if such a deadline is not required according to statutory provisions.",
    "(4) The Buyer is authorized to resell and/or process the Goods subject to retention of title in the proper course of business until revoked (c) below.",
    " 1. The retention of title extends to the products created by processing, mixing, or combining our Goods to their full value, with us being considered the manufacturer/supplier. If the ownership rights of third parties remain in force during processing, mixing, or combining with goods of third parties, we acquire co-ownership in proportion to the invoiced value of the processed, mixed, or combined goods. The same applies to the created product as for the Goods delivered under retention of title.",
    " 2. The Buyer hereby assigns to us all claims arising from the resale of the Goods or the product in their entirety or to the extent of our possible co-ownership share pursuant to the preceding paragraph. We accept the assignment. The Buyer's obligations mentioned in paragraph 2 also apply in view of the assigned claims.",
    " 3. The Buyer remains authorized to collect the claim in addition to us. We undertake not to collect the claim as long as the Buyer meets their payment obligations to us, is not in default, there is no lack of performance capability, and we do not assert the retention of title by exercising a right according to paragraph 3. If this is the case, we can request that the Buyer informs us of the assigned claims and their debtors, provides all information necessary for collection, hands over the associated documents, and notifies the debtors (third parties) of the assignment. In this case, we are also entitled to revoke the Buyer's authority to resell and process the Goods subject to retention of title.",
    " 4. If the realizable value of the securities exceeds our claims by more than 10%, we are obliged to release the securities at our discretion upon the Buyer's request.",
    "- 7 Buyer's Warranty Claims&div&bold",
    "(1) Exclusive for Goods, the statutory provisions apply for defects in quality and title (including wrong and short deliveries and improper assembly or defective assembly instructions), unless otherwise stated below.",
    " 1. The Buyer's warranty claims are conditional upon their compliance with statutory obligations to inspect and give notice of defects (§§ 377, 381 HGB). If a defect becomes apparent during delivery, inspection, or at any later point, it must be reported in writing without delay. In any case, obvious defects must be reported within 2 working days from delivery and defects not discoverable during inspection must be reported in writing within the same period from discovery. Failure by the Buyer to carry out a proper inspection and/or give notice of defects results in the exclusion of our liability for any defect not or not timely or not properly reported, according to the statutory provisions.",
    " 2. The Buyer was advised that for the proper operating condition of the equipment, maintenance must be carried out by an authorized specialist workshop according to the manufacturer's requirements after the first 50 hours and every 250 operating hours thereafter. Failure to comply with this condition extinguishes any warranty claims. In the context of a warranty claim, the Buyer must provide relevant evidence in the form of invoices and entries in the service booklet.",
    " 3. Warranty claims for defects in quality expire within one year.",
    " 4. The Buyer bears the transport costs for the return of the Goods for subsequent performance/improvement/warranty claims to the place of subsequent performance at the company's registered office of HYTEC and back to the Buyer.",
    "(2) For all other Goods, the Buyer's rights for defects in quality and title (including wrong and short deliveries and improper assembly or defective assembly instructions) are excluded.",
    "- 8 Other Liability&div&bold",
    "(1) To the extent that these GTC, including the subsequent provisions, do not state otherwise, we are liable for the breach of contractual and non-contractual obligations according to the statutory provisions.",
    "(2) We are liable for damages – regardless of the legal grounds – in case of willful intent and gross negligence. In case of ordinary negligence, we are liable, subject to a milder liability standard pursuant to statutory provisions (e.g., for care in our own affairs), only",
    " 1. for damages arising from injury to life, body, or health,",
    " 2. for damages arising from a not insubstantial breach of a material contractual obligation (an obligation, the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract and on the compliance of which the contractual partner regularly relies and may rely); in this case, however, our liability is limited to the replacement of the foreseeable, typically occurring damage.",
    "(3) The liability restrictions resulting from paragraph 2 also apply to breaches of obligations by or in favor of persons whose fault we are responsible for according to statutory provisions. They do not apply to the extent we have maliciously concealed a defect or have assumed a guarantee for the quality of the Goods, and for the Buyer's claims under the Product Liability Act.",
    "(4) The Buyer may only withdraw or cancel a contract in case of a breach of contract that does not consist of a defect. A free right of cancellation by the Buyer (in particular, according to §§ 651, 649 BGB) is excluded. In all other respects, the statutory conditions and consequences apply.",
    "- 9 Statute of Limitations&div&bold",
    "(1) In derogation from § 195 BGB, the general statute of limitations for claims arising from the purchase contracts is one year. If an acceptance has been agreed, the statute of limitations begins with the acceptance. This does not apply to liability due to intent (see § 202 (1) BGB).",
    "(2) However, damage claims of the Buyer according to § 8 (2) sentence 1 and sentence 2(a) as well as under the Product Liability Act expire exclusively according to the statutory statutes of limitations.",
    "- 10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction&div&bold",
    "(1) For these GTC and the contractual relationship between us and the Buyer, the law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding international uniform law, in particular the UN Sales of Goods (CISG).",
    "(2) If the Buyer is a merchant according to the German Commercial Code (HGB), a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the exclusive – including international – place of jurisdiction for all disputes directly or indirectly resulting from the contractual relationship is our place of business in 21423 Winsen/Luhe. The same applies if the Buyer is a businessman according to § 14 BGB. However, we are also entitled to sue the Buyer at the place of performance of the delivery obligation according to these GTC or a prior individual agreement, or at the general place of jurisdiction of the Buyer. Mandatory statutory provisions on exclusive jurisdictions remain unaffected.",
    "- 11 Final Provisions&div&bold",
    "If individual provisions should be or become invalid for any reason, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Changes require written form. The requirement of written form also applies to any amendment of this written form requirement."
